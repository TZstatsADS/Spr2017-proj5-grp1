 NBA 2015-2016 season was unforgettable. The Golden State Warriors 73-9 made
 history. For the playoffs, OKC ended their journey even though they got 3-0 over GSW
 at first. Following that, the same situation happened to GSW: at the finals, GSW beat CLE by 3-0, but they dramatically lost the following 4 games. 

 This is why NBA is so enchanting. You can never predict what the game would be
 like till the last minutes.

 Then why this project? We were eager to see how computer, a machine without subjective opinions about NBA and the teams, predicts the result of the game, using purely on data given.  It turns out to be surprisingly good!

+ We published a ShinyApp to give a more interactive way for data visualization:
